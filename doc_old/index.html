<h2>Work</h2>
<p style="width:600px">
I've moved to the other side of the Imperial campus to
become a leturer in the Dept. of Electrical and Electronic
Engineering. I'm still involved with the Dept. of Computing,
both through teaching and PhD supervision, but my web-page has
<a href="http://cas.ee.ic.ac.uk/people/dt10">moved here</a>.
</p>
<p style="width:600px">
I'll probably keep all the links here working for a while,
and the research and teaching links are dealt with through
HTTP 301 permanent moves to their new home, but don't
expect too many updates here (not that it was a storm of
activity normally).

We are hosting <a href="http://asap2016.org">ASAP 2016</a>.
